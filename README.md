## The software factory for small teams of expert engineers

Arc replaces the prompt-wait-review loop with version-controlled workflow graphs that orchestrate AI agents, shell commands, and human decisions into repeatable, long-horizon coding processes.

Define workflows in Graphviz DOT, route tasks to the right model with CSS-like stylesheets, and let the engine handle orchestration, parallelism, checkpointing, and verification -- all from a single Rust binary.

## Key Features

### What Arc Does

|     | Feature                    | Description                                                                                |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :robot: | Multi-model orchestration   | Route tasks to the right model per node -- cheap for boilerplate, frontier for hard reasoning |
| :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: | Declarative workflows       | Define pipelines in Graphviz DOT -- diffable, reviewable, composable                        |
| :raised_hand: | Human-in-the-loop          | Approval gates, interviews, and real-time steering let you intervene at the right moments   |
| :arrows_counterclockwise: | Checkpoint and resume       | Git-native checkpointing after every stage -- inspect, revert, or fork from any point        |
| :shield: | Adaptive verification      | Combine LLM-as-judge, test suites, and human review into quality gates                      |
| :bar_chart: | Full observability          | Every tool call, agent turn, and decision point captured in a unified event stream           |

### How Arc Does It

|     | Feature                 | Description                                                                              |
| --- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :art: | Model stylesheets        | CSS-like selectors (`*`, `.class`, `#id`) assign models, providers, and reasoning effort |
| :deciduous_tree: | Git-native checkpoints   | Every stage commits to a branch -- resume interrupted runs exactly where they left off    |
| :package: | Sandbox isolation        | Run agent tools in local, Docker, Daytona cloud VMs, or exe.dev ephemeral VMs            |
| :electric_plug: | MCP integration          | Extend agents with any Model Context Protocol server (Playwright, databases, APIs)       |
| :repeat: | Loops and fan-out        | Implement-test-fix cycles, parallel code reviews, and ensemble multi-provider patterns   |
| :crab: | Written in Rust          | Single compiled binary with minimal dependencies -- no Python runtime, no npm install     |
| :gear: | CLI and API modes        | `arc run` for local dev, `arc serve` for production with a React web UI                  |

## Example Workflow

A plan-approve-implement workflow where a human reviews the plan before the agent writes code:

```dot
digraph PlanImplement {
    graph [goal="Plan, approve, implement, and simplify a change"]

    start [shape=Mdiamond, label="Start"]
    exit  [shape=Msquare, label="Exit"]

    plan      [label="Plan", prompt="Analyze the goal and codebase. Write a step-by-step plan.", reasoning_effort="high"]
    approve   [shape=hexagon, label="Approve Plan"]
    implement [label="Implement", prompt="Read plan.md and implement every step."]
    simplify  [label="Simplify", prompt="Review the changes for clarity and correctness."]

    start -> plan -> approve
    approve -> implement [label="[A] Approve"]
    approve -> plan      [label="[R] Revise"]
    implement -> simplify -> exit
}
```

### Node types at a glance

| Shape            | Type        | What it does                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Mdiamond`       | Start       | Workflow entry point                             |
| `Msquare`        | Exit        | Workflow terminal                                |
| `box` (default)  | Agent       | Multi-turn LLM with tool access                 |
| `tab`            | Prompt      | Single LLM call, no tools                        |
| `parallelogram`  | Command     | Runs a shell script                              |
| `hexagon`        | Human gate  | Pauses for human input                           |
| `diamond`        | Conditional | Routes based on conditions                       |
| `component`      | Parallel    | Fans out to concurrent branches                  |
| `tripleoctagon`  | Merge       | Collects parallel branch results                 |

### Multi-model routing with stylesheets

```dot
graph [
    model_stylesheet="
        *        { llm_model: claude-haiku-4-5; reasoning_effort: low; }
        .coding  { llm_model: claude-sonnet-4-5; reasoning_effort: high; }
        #review  { llm_model: gemini-3.1-pro-preview; llm_provider: gemini; }
    "
]
```

Selectors follow CSS specificity: `*` (0) < `shape` (1) < `.class` (2) < `#id` (3).

## Supported Models

Arc supports models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Kimi, Zai, MiniMax, and Inception. Route tasks to the right model per node and configure provider fallback chains per-run.

Run `arc model list` locally or see the [Models documentation](https://arc.dev/core-concepts/models) for the full catalog.

---

## System Requirements

- **macOS** (Apple Silicon) or **Linux** (x86_64)
- **At least one LLM provider API key** (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini)
- **Git** (for checkpoint and resume)
- **Rust** (only if building from source)
