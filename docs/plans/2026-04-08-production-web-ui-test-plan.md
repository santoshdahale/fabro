# Production Web UI Test Plan

## Harness requirements

### 1. Rust HTTP integration harness (existing)

- **What it does:** Sends HTTP requests to the fabro server via `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot()` against an in-memory `AppState`. No network, no boot overhead.
- **What it exposes:** Full request/response cycle including headers, status codes, JSON bodies. Direct mutation of `AppState` (e.g., setting run status) for precondition setup.
- **Estimated complexity:** Already exists (`lib/crates/fabro-server/tests/it/helpers.rs`). Provides `test_app_state()`, `build_router()`, `body_json()`, `create_and_start_run()`, `api()`, etc.
- **Which tests depend on it:** Tests 1-6

### 2. Playwright browser harness (new -- must be built)

- **What it does:** Launches a real browser against a running fabro server that serves the built SPA. Exercises the full stack: React app fetching real HTTP endpoints, rendering real DOM, cookies for demo mode.
- **What it exposes:** Page navigation, DOM element inspection, cookie management, screenshot capture, click/interaction simulation.
- **Estimated complexity:** Moderate. Requires:
  1. Install `@playwright/test` as a dev dependency in `apps/fabro-web`
  2. Create `apps/fabro-web/tests/playwright.config.ts` with `webServer` config that builds the SPA and starts the fabro server with `AuthMode::Disabled` and in-memory store
  3. The server already serves the built SPA when `FABRO_STATIC_DIR` is configured. Auth disabled mode returns a synthetic user from `/auth/me`.
- **Which tests depend on it:** Tests 7-14

### 3. TypeScript unit test harness (existing)

- **What it does:** Runs bun tests for pure TypeScript functions and React component logic.
- **What it exposes:** Direct function calls, React `renderToString` for context providers.
- **Estimated complexity:** Already exists (`bun test`).
- **Which tests depend on it:** Tests 15-18

- **Type:** boundary
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** Rust HTTP integration harness
- **Preconditions:** Server initialized. A run created and started, then set to `RunStatus::Failed`.
- **Actions:** `GET /api/v1/boards/runs` (no demo header)

- **Actions:** Navigate to `/runs`.
- **Expected outcome:** Page loads. Body does not contain "Unauthorized" or "500" or "error" (case-insensitive check excluding expected UI text). Screenshot captured as artifact at `test-results/runs-prod.png`. Source of truth: User request ("make it production grade" -- the runs board is the primary view and must render).
- **Interactions:** React Router loader -> `apiFetch("/boards/runs")` -> server real `list_board_runs` handler

### Test 8: Navigation hides Workflows and Insights in production mode (browser)

- **Name:** The sidebar/header navigation does not show Workflows or Insights links when not in demo mode
- **Type:** scenario
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** Playwright browser harness
- **Preconditions:** Server running, no demo cookie.
- **Actions:** Navigate to `/runs`. Inspect the `nav` element.
- **Expected outcome:** `nav` element does NOT contain text "Workflows". `nav` element does NOT contain text "Insights". `nav` element DOES contain text "Runs". Source of truth: Plan Decision 4 and user request ("remove the corresponding UI from fabro web for now").
- **Interactions:** App shell loader -> `getAuthMe()` -> `demoMode: false` -> `getVisibleNavigation(false)` filters out demo-only items

### Test 9: Settings page loads in production mode (browser)

- **Name:** The settings page loads successfully in production mode since /settings is implemented in the real server
- **Type:** scenario
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** Playwright browser harness
- **Preconditions:** Server running, no demo cookie.
- **Actions:** Navigate to `/settings`.
- **Expected outcome:** Page loads without "Not implemented" or "500" error text. Screenshot captured at `test-results/settings-prod.png`. Source of truth: Real server route table has `get(get_server_settings)` for `/settings`.
- **Interactions:** Settings route loader -> `apiJson("/settings")` -> real `get_server_settings` handler

### Test 10: Demo mode runs board shows demo data (browser)

- **Name:** Navigating to the runs board with the demo cookie set renders demo run data
- **Type:** scenario
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** Playwright browser harness
- **Preconditions:** Server running. `fabro-demo=1` cookie set for localhost.
- **Actions:** Navigate to `/runs`.
- **Expected outcome:** Page loads without error. Body content is not empty/blank (confirms demo data rendered). Screenshot captured at `test-results/runs-demo.png`. Source of truth: Plan Decision 2 (demo `/boards/runs` returns demo run list items).
- **Interactions:** Demo cookie -> server `X-Fabro-Demo` middleware -> demo `list_board_runs` -> demo run data

### Test 11: Navigation shows all items in demo mode (browser)

- **Name:** The navigation shows Workflows, Runs, and Insights links when in demo mode
- **Type:** scenario
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** Playwright browser harness
- **Preconditions:** Server running. Demo cookie set.
- **Actions:** Navigate to `/runs`. Inspect `nav` element.
- **Expected outcome:** `nav` contains "Workflows", "Runs", and "Insights". Source of truth: Plan Decision 4 -- all nav items visible in demo mode.
- **Interactions:** App shell loader -> `getAuthMe()` -> `demoMode: true` -> `getVisibleNavigation(true)` includes all items

### Test 12: Workflows page loads in demo mode (browser)

- **Name:** The workflows page renders successfully when in demo mode
- **Type:** scenario
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** Playwright browser harness
- **Preconditions:** Server running. Demo cookie set.
- **Actions:** Navigate to `/workflows`.
- **Expected outcome:** Page loads without "error" or "500" text. Screenshot captured at `test-results/workflows-demo.png`. Source of truth: Demo routes include workflow handlers.
- **Interactions:** Workflows route loader -> demo workflow handlers

### Test 13: Toggling demo mode changes navigation (browser)

- **Name:** Clicking the demo toggle button switches between production and demo navigation
- **Type:** scenario

- **Harness:** Playwright browser harness
- **Preconditions:** Server running. No demo cookie initially.
- **Actions:**
  1. Navigate to `/runs`
  2. Verify nav does NOT contain "Workflows"
  3. Click the beaker button (demo toggle -- `button[title*="demo"], button[title*="Demo"]`)
  4. Wait for page to revalidate
  5. Verify nav now DOES contain "Workflows"
- **Expected outcome:** Before toggle: no "Workflows" in nav. After toggle: "Workflows" appears in nav. Screenshot captured at `test-results/after-toggle-demo.png`. Source of truth: Plan Decision 4 -- `toggleDemoMode()` posts to `/api/v1/demo/toggle`, sets cookie, revalidates, `demoMode` changes, nav re-renders.
- **Interactions:** Demo toggle button -> `POST /demo/toggle` -> cookie set -> revalidate -> `getAuthMe()` returns `demoMode: true` -> `getVisibleNavigation(true)`

- **Type:** scenario
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** Playwright browser harness
- **Preconditions:** Server running with in-memory store, no demo cookie, no runs created.
- **Actions:** Navigate to `/runs/nonexistent-id`.
- **Expected outcome:** Page renders (may show "Run not found" message). Does NOT crash with unhandled error or blank page. Source of truth: Plan Decision 6 -- run-detail loader uses `/runs/{id}` which returns 404, and component handles `run: null`.
- **Interactions:** Run detail loader -> `apiJson("/runs/nonexistent-id")` -> 404 -> graceful error handling

### Test 15: `mapRunSummaryToRunItem` correctly maps StoreRunSummary fields to RunItem

- **Preconditions:** None (pure function).
- **Actions:** Call `mapRunSummaryToRunItem()` with a complete `RunSummaryResponse` object containing `run_id`, `goal`, `workflow_slug`, `host_repo_path`, `duration_ms`.
- **Expected outcome:** Returns `RunItem` with `id` equal to `run_id`, `title` equal to `goal`, `workflow` equal to `workflow_slug`, `repo` equal to last segment of `host_repo_path`, `elapsed` formatted from `duration_ms`. Source of truth: Plan Decision 6 field mapping specification.
- **Interactions:** `formatElapsedSecs()` from `lib/format.ts`

### Test 16: `mapRunSummaryToRunItem` handles null optional fields

- **Name:** The mapping function provides sensible defaults when optional fields are null
- **Type:** boundary
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** TypeScript unit test harness (bun test)
- **Preconditions:** None (pure function).
- **Actions:** Call `mapRunSummaryToRunItem()` with all optional fields set to null (`goal: null`, `workflow_slug: null`, `host_repo_path: null`, `duration_ms: null`).
- **Expected outcome:** Returns `RunItem` with `title: "Untitled run"`, `workflow: "unknown"`, `repo: "unknown"`, `elapsed: undefined`. Source of truth: Plan Task 4 step 3 default values.
- **Interactions:** None

- **Name:** The React context correctly propagates the demo mode boolean to consumer components
- **Type:** unit
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** TypeScript unit test harness (bun test)
- **Preconditions:** None.
- **Actions:** Render `<DemoModeProvider value={true}><TestConsumer /></DemoModeProvider>` using `renderToString`. `TestConsumer` reads `useDemoMode()`.
- **Expected outcome:** Rendered HTML contains `data-demo="true"` and text "demo". Source of truth: Plan Decision 7 -- `DemoModeProvider` wraps `Outlet` with context value.
- **Interactions:** React context system

### Test 18: `getVisibleNavigation` filters demo-only items in production mode

- **Name:** The navigation filtering function excludes demo-only navigation items when not in demo mode
- **Type:** unit
- **Disposition:** new
- **Harness:** TypeScript unit test harness (bun test)
- **Preconditions:** None (pure function).
- **Actions:** Call `getVisibleNavigation(false)` and `getVisibleNavigation(true)`.
- **Expected outcome:** `getVisibleNavigation(false)` returns items that include "Runs" but NOT "Workflows" or "Insights". `getVisibleNavigation(true)` returns items that include "Runs", "Workflows", and "Insights". Source of truth: Plan Decision 4 -- Workflows and Insights are `demoOnly: true`.
- **Interactions:** None

| Workflows page in demo mode | 12 | Browser |

### Explicitly excluded (per agreed strategy)

| Area | Reason | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Run stages tab rendering | Hidden in production mode; demo-only route. Unchanged code. | Low -- existing demo data path untouched. |
| Run files tab | Always hidden (endpoint does not exist). Tab removed from UI. | None. |
| Insights page deep interaction | Demo-only route. Unchanged code. Out of scope per "remove UI for removed functionality." | Low. |
| Workflow detail/diagram/runs pages | Demo-only routes. Static data, unchanged. | Low. |
| Run overview graph rendering (Graphviz) | Depends on `@viz-js/viz` WASM, hard to test in headless browser. Loader resilience tested via browser smoke. | Medium -- if WASM fails to load, graph won't render, but the page will still load with "No workflow graph available" fallback. |
| Run billing tab | Unchanged, already works in both modes. | None. |
| SSE event streaming | Unchanged, not part of this task. | None. |
| Performance benchmarks | Low performance risk -- no new hot paths, board query is bounded by in-memory run count. | Low. |
| Existing server test regressions from `/boards/runs` shape change | Existing tests that assert `status_reason`/`pending_control` from `/boards/runs` will need updating. Covered by implementation plan Task 3 Step 5, verified by running full `cargo nextest run -p fabro-server`. | Medium -- if missed, existing tests fail, caught immediately by CI. |
