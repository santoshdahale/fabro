# Fabro Events Strategy

Fabro emits structured **workflow run events** during execution for observability. Events are the durable audit trail for a run: they drive `progress.jsonl`, `live.json`, the run store, SSE streaming, CLI progress rendering, and retro analysis.

Events are distinct from tracing logs. Tracing is developer diagnostics; events are product-facing state transitions and activity records that other systems consume.

Detached runs rely on this distinction. If something needs to be visible after reattach, emit a `WorkflowRunEvent` rather than only logging to stderr or `detach.log`.

## Architecture

```text
Engine/Handler -> WorkflowRunEvent -> EventEmitter::emit()
                                       |- trace(raw event)
                                       |- canonicalize -> RunEventEnvelope
                                       `- on_event(&RunEventEnvelope)
                                             |- progress.jsonl + live.json
                                             |- run store
                                             |- SSE
                                             `- CLI / tests / metrics listeners
```

The canonical envelope is built exactly once in `fabro-workflow/src/event.rs`.

- `WorkflowRunEvent` remains the internal typed source of truth.
- `EventEmitter` owns an immutable `run_id` and converts typed events into `RunEventEnvelope`.
- Every listener receives `&RunEventEnvelope`, not `&WorkflowRunEvent`.
- Bypass paths that cannot go through the emitter must call `canonicalize_event()` once and reuse the same envelope for every sink.

## Canonical Envelope

Each line in `progress.jsonl` is a `RunEventEnvelope`:

```json
{
  "id": "01960d0c-5d16-7d6e-8f61-9fd6f4a532b5",
  "ts": "2026-03-30T12:00:01.000Z",
  "run_id": "01JQ...",
  "event": "agent.tool.started",
  "session_id": "ses_child",
  "parent_session_id": "ses_parent",
  "node_id": "code",
  "node_label": "Code",
  "properties": {
    "tool_name": "read_file",
    "tool_call_id": "call_1",
    "arguments": {"path": "src/main.rs"}
  }
}
```

Always-present fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | UUIDv7 event id |
| `ts` | string | UTC timestamp with millisecond precision |
| `run_id` | string | Workflow run id |
| `event` | string | Lowercase dot-notation event name |

Optional top-level fields:

| Field | When present |
|---|---|
| `session_id` | Agent/session events |
| `parent_session_id` | Forwarded child-session events |
| `node_id` | Events tied to a graph node or branch |
| `node_label` | Display label for `node_id`; omitted when not applicable |

Everything else lives inside `properties`.

Important rules:

- Optional envelope fields are omitted, not serialized as `null`.
- Event-specific fields do not get flattened into the top level.
- `EventPayload` validation requires `id`, `ts`, `run_id`, and `event`.

## Naming

The external event name is lowercase dot notation, for example:

- `run.started`
- `stage.completed`
- `agent.tool.started`
- `sandbox.ready`
- `parallel.branch.completed`

`event_name()` in `event.rs` is exhaustive. Do not use wildcard fallthroughs when adding new variants.

## Node And Session Metadata

`node_id` is the stable graph identifier. `node_label` is the human-facing display name. Stage events should surface both through the envelope when applicable.

Agent events now use explicit session links:

- `session_id` identifies the session that originally emitted the event.
- `parent_session_id` identifies the immediate parent session for forwarded child events.
- Nested sub-agents preserve immediate parentage across boundaries.

`AgentEvent::SubAgentEvent` no longer exists. Child activity is forwarded as normal agent events with session linkage in the envelope.

## Direct-Write Paths

Most events flow through `EventEmitter::emit()`. The remaining direct-write paths must use:

1. `canonicalize_event(run_id, event)`
2. Serialize and redact once
3. Reuse that exact serialized envelope for every sink

Never canonicalize the same logical event twice if multiple sinks receive it.

## Adding A New Event

### 1. Add the typed event

Add a variant to `WorkflowRunEvent`, `AgentEvent`, or `SandboxEvent` as appropriate.

### 2. Add tracing

Extend `WorkflowRunEvent::trace()` so the raw event is observable in tracing output.

### 3. Add an external name

Extend `event_name()` with the new lowercase dot-notation string.

### 4. Map envelope fields

Update `extract_envelope_fields()`:

- Move `node_id`, `node_label`, `session_id`, and `parent_session_id` into the envelope when appropriate.
- Keep event-specific data in `properties`.
- Flatten structured failure details into explicit property keys when needed.

### 5. Emit it

Prefer `EventEmitter::emit(&WorkflowRunEvent::...)`.

Use `canonicalize_event()` only for true bypass paths.

### 6. Update consumers

Check:

- CLI progress parsing
- `fabro logs`
- retro duration extraction
- store validation
- tests or fixtures that inspect event names or fields

## Consumer Guidance

When writing listeners:

- Match on `envelope.event`, not Rust variant names.
- Read event payload from `envelope.properties`.
- Read stage/branch identity from `node_id` and `node_label`.
- Read agent hierarchy from `session_id` and `parent_session_id`.

Do not rebuild or mutate the envelope in downstream listeners.

## Bypass And Persistence Guarantees

`progress.jsonl`, the run store, and SSE should reflect the same canonical envelope bytes after redaction.

`status.json` remains the authoritative completion signal for detached runs. Terminal run status should only be written after all post-run work is finished.
